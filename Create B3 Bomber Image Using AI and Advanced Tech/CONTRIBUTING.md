#### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple
import torch
import numpy as np

class NeuralProcessor:
    """
    Advanced neural signal processor for EEG/fMRI data.
    
    This class implements state-of-the-art signal processing
    techniques for brain-computer interface applications.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, sampling_rate: float = 1000.0) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the neural processor.
        
        Args:
            sampling_rate: Signal sampling rate in Hz
        """
        self.sampling_rate = sampling_rate
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)
    
    def process_signal(self, 
                      signal: np.ndarray,
                      channels: List[str]) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Dict[str, float]]:
        """
        Process neural signal with advanced filtering.
        
        Args:
            signal: Raw neural signal data (channels, time)
            channels: Channel names/labels
            
        Returns:
            Processed signal and quality metrics
            
        Raises:
            SignalProcessingError: If signal processing fails
        """
        try:
            # Implementation here
            processed_signal = self._apply_filters(signal)
            quality_metrics = self._assess_quality(processed_signal)
            
            return processed_signal, quality_metrics
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Signal processing failed: {e}")
            raise SignalProcessingError(f"Processing failed: {e}")
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests

All new code must include comprehensive unit tests:

```python
import pytest
import numpy as np
from src.neural_interface import NeuralProcessor

class TestNeuralProcessor:
    """Test suite for NeuralProcessor class."""
    
    def setup_method(self):
        """Setup test fixtures."""
        self.processor = NeuralProcessor(sampling_rate=1000.0)
        self.test_signal = np.random.randn(64, 1000)
        self.channels = [f"Ch{i}" for i in range(64)]
    
    def test_signal_processing(self):
        """Test basic signal processing functionality."""
        processed, metrics = self.processor.process_signal(
            self.test_signal, self.channels
        )
        
        assert processed.shape == self.test_signal.shape
        assert isinstance(metrics, dict)
        assert 'snr' in metrics
        assert 'quality_score' in metrics
    
    def test_invalid_input(self):
        """Test handling of invalid inputs."""
        with pytest.raises(SignalProcessingError):
            self.processor.process_signal(np.array([]), [])
```

#### Integration Tests

```python
import asyncio
import pytest
from src.fusion import EnhancedB2SpiritAI, EnhancedFusionConfig
from src.neural_interface import NeuralSignal

@pytest.mark.asyncio
class TestSystemIntegration:
    """Integration tests for the complete system."""
    
    async def test_full_analysis_pipeline(self):
        """Test complete analysis pipeline with neural interface."""
        config = EnhancedFusionConfig(neural_interface_enabled=True)
        system = EnhancedB2SpiritAI(config)
        
        # Create test data
        neural_signal = NeuralSignal(
            eeg_data=np.random.randn(64, 1000),
            sampling_rate=1000.0,
            channels=[f"Ch{i}" for i in range(64)]
        )
        
        # Run analysis
        result = await system.enhanced_analyze(
            neural_signal=neural_signal,
            mission_context={'phase': 'test'}
        )
        
        assert result.confidence_score > 0.0
        assert result.decoded_thoughts is not None
        assert result.mind_machine_sync is not None
```

### Documentation Standards

#### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def decode_neural_language(signal: np.ndarray, 
                          context: LanguageContext) -> InterpretedLanguage:
    """
    Decode language from neural signals with contextual interpretation.
    
    This function processes raw neural signals and converts them into
    interpreted language with full contextual awareness and multilingual
    support.
    
    Args:
        signal: Raw neural signal data with shape (channels, time_points).
               Should be preprocessed and artifact-free.
        context: Language and contextual information including domain,
                urgency level, and mission phase.
    
    Returns:
        Comprehensive language interpretation result including:
        - Decoded text content
        - Language detection and translation
        - Intent classification and urgency assessment
        - Actionable command extraction
        - Cognitive state analysis
    
    Raises:
        LanguageDecodingError: If neural language decoding fails due to
                              poor signal quality or model errors.
        ContextError: If the provided context is invalid or incomplete.
    
    Example:
        >>> context = LanguageContext(
        ...     primary_language="en",
        ...     domain_context="military",
        ...     urgency_level="high"
        ... )
        >>> result = decode_neural_language(eeg_signal, context)
        >>> print(f"Decoded: {result.interpreted_text}")
        >>> print(f"Commands: {result.actionable_commands}")
    
    Note:
        This function requires a trained neural language model and
        proper EEG signal preprocessing. Signal quality should be
        assessed before calling this function.
    """
